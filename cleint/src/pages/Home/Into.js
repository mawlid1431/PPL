        I’m Mowlid Mohamoud, and I’m deeply passionate about community
        development, technology, and creating positive change. Based in
        Hargeisa, Somaliland, I’m driven by the belief that communities have the
        power to uplift and transform lives. My journey has been shaped by a
        commitment to harnessing this power through technology, innovation, and
        active community engagement. With a rich background in both technology
        and community-focused roles, I bring a unique perspective to every
        project. Whether it’s through organizing impactful events, developing
        user-friendly technology solutions, or volunteering for meaningful
        causes, my goal is always to make a tangible difference. I’m
        enthusiastic about leveraging my skills to foster growth, empowerment,
        and progress within my community.
